# User Authentication System

## About 😄
This project is a user authentication system that enables users to sign up and log in securely. Built with the powerful and flexible MERN stack, this system ensures robust performance and scalability. The frontend is developed using React and the Vite package for a fast and efficient user experience, while the backend is handled by Node.js and Express.js, providing a solid foundation for handling URL routings and server-side logic. MongoDB serves as the database, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval. 

## Tech Stack : MERN ⚙️
* **MongoDB**: Used as the database to store user information.
* **Express.js**: Manages backend URL routings and server-side logic.
* **React + Vite**: Creates a dynamic and responsive frontend.
* **Node.js**: Powers the backend, using nodemon for efficient development.

## Frameworks and Tools 🧰
* **bcrypt**: Ensures user security by hashing passwords. This adds an additional layer of security, making it difficult for attackers to gain access to user data.
* **react-router-dom**: Handles routing in the frontend, providing a seamless navigation experience.
* **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Provides secure user authentication and session management by issuing tokens that verify user identity.
* **cookie parser**: Parses cookies to manage user sessions, allowing the server to identify and authenticate users based on their session tokens.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for styling the frontend with a modern and responsive design, making the user interface clean and intuitive.

## Key Features 🔑
* **Secure Sign-Up and Login**: Users can create accounts and log in securely.
* **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, enhancing security by making it difficult to reverse-engineer passwords.
* **Session Management**: User sessions are tracked using JWT and cookies, ensuring secure and reliable authentication.
* **Responsive Design**: The frontend is styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive user interface.
* **Efficient Development**: Utilizes Vite for fast build times and hot module replacement, improving the development experience.
